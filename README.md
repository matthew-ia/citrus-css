# citrus-css
A slim CSS framework that uses Sass.

Two versions:
- Citrus No-pulp (default, barebones)
- Citrus Pulp (heavier, has more component/other classes from Bootstrap)

*Based on Bootstrap 3.3.7*



**Notes**

- `.keep` files are just there to add/commit/push an empty directory. You can delete `.keep` any time you want!

### In Queue:


- Accessibility mixins and variables
- Designer-oriented features (?)
- add note about custom variables (in `_citrus.scss`)
