# README - Bootstrap for Sass: Starter Kit

You can use this guide however you'd like, but here are some of the ways its been set up to use:

1. Download `project.zip`. Open `pub/index.html`. That file is an HTML version of the guide, that you can both follow along with in another window *and* see how Bootstrap can be used regarding the basics of the responsive classes and utilities, and custom styling/variables without explicitly changing Bootstrap defaults.
2. Follow the Markdown version of the guide on GitHub or with Brackets & the Brackets Markdown Preview extension.
3. Don't follow the guide at all and just use the `project` folder as a starting point for a new project and learn on your own. 

Recommended links/downloads before you start: 
- A great IDE for web development: [Brackets](brackets.io) and recommended Brackets extensions:
    - [Brackets Markdown Preview](https://bitbucket.org/begue/brackets-markdown-preview/src) - Makes this guide easy to follow along while looking at your directory if you don't want to use the HTML version.
    - [Custom Work](https://github.com/DH3ALEJANDRO/custom-work-for-brackets) - Arguably the most useful extension; creates tabs for working files, icons for directory sidebar.
    - [New Moon theme](https://github.com/taniarascia/new-moon) - A great theme for those who enjoy dark workspaces.
